Creality Ender 3 S1 running on Klipper, Moonraker and Fluidd

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a continuous journey, getting the Ender 3 S1 running as consitantly as possible on Klipper.

All these settings are for my specific setup. For example my printer is facing me sideways  (see picture). But they can be altered to fit yours. I will not be responsible if the files don't meet your setup or if they break your machine. 

These are file I'm currently using with my Ender 3 S1.

I'll try list all guides and documents I used. And list links to all addons I downloaded or created for my setup.

A lot of the printer.cfg and macros and here comes from or was created with help from so many helpful people on Discord, Reddit. 

I hope these files help getting started with klipper on your Ender 3 S1. Even if it is just one person.

Thanks to all and happy printing!
